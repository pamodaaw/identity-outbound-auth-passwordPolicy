# Password Policy
The password policy enables you to force the user to reset the password in the authentication flow in the WSO2 Identity Server. This along with IS Analytics also enables sending notifications to users when the password had expired.

## Getting started
To get started with the password policy, go to [Configuring Password Reset Enforcer](./config.md). Once you have completed your configurations you can make the users reset their password after a configurable time period and also send email notifications to login and change the password.
